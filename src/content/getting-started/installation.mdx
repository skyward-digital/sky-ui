import { Button } from "#/ui/components/Button"

## 1. Download the component files

Head on over to our LemonSqueezy store and download the free or premium version of the library.

[Download SkywardUI](https://skyward.lemonsqueezy.com/)

## 2. Add Tailwind CSS to your project

Components are styled using Tailwind CSS, so you'll need to install it in your project.

https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation

## 3. Setup dependencies in your project

Install additional dependencies required by the component.

```bash
npm install clsx tailwind-merge
```

## 4. Add icon library

Our components use UntitledUI icons line icon set, which you'll also need to install. This is a free icon set, which you can use in your projects.

```bash
npm install @untitledui-icons/react
```

UntitledUI provides other versions of their icons (solid, duotone, etc), which [you can purchase on their store](https://store.untitledui.com?aff=ze5Pg).

If you choose to do this you'll need to update the package imports to use the new version. You won't need to update the icon names.

```tsx
- import { XCloseIcon } from '@untitledui-icons/react/line'
+ import { XCloseIcon } from '@untitledui-icons/react/duotone'
```

If you want to use your own icon library, you can replace the icons in the components. You'll need to update the imports and the new icon names.

```tsx
- import { XCloseIcon } from '@untitledui-icons/react/line'
+ import { XMarkIcon } from '@heroicons/react/outline'
```

## 5. Configure path aliases

Add the following path aliases to your `tsconfig.json` file.

If you prefer to use a different path alias, you can update the `#` alias to your preference (make sure to update the other imports too).

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "#/*": ["./*"]
    }
  }
}
```

## 6. Install your fonts

We use GeistSans and GeistMono for our components. These are variable fonts provided by Vercel.

Download them from the [Vercel website](https://vercel.com/font/sans) and place them in your public folder.

You can switch these for any other fonts if you'd like. You'll need to update the `tailwind.config.js` file in the next step.

## 7. Configure tailwind.config.js

We try and keep our tailwind file as close to the default as possible, but there are a few things that are different.

You can copy the following configuration and update it to your needs.

GeistSans and GeistMono are custom variable fonts used in SkywardUI. You can remove these if you wish.
If you want to use alternate variable fonts update the `fontFamily` and `fontVariationSettings` accordingly, otherwise it's safe to remove them.

```js
import type { Config } from "tailwindcss"
import { fontFamily } from "tailwindcss/defaultTheme"

module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{astro,html,js,jsx,md,mdx,svelte,ts,tsx,vue}",
    "./ui/**/*.{astro,html,js,jsx,md,mdx,svelte,ts,tsx,vue}",
  ],
  future: {
    hoverOnlyWhenSupported: true,
  },
  darkMode: "class",
  theme: {
    container: {
      center: true,
      padding: "1rem",
    },
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        sans: [
          `Geist, ${fontFamily.sans}`,
          {
            fontVariationSettings: '"wght" 80',
          },
        ],
        mono: [
          `GeistMono, ${fontFamily.mono}`,
          {
            fontVariationSettings: '"wght" 80',
          },
        ],
      },
      zIndex: {
        "-10": "-10",
      },
      strokeWidth: {
        0.5: "0.5",
        1.5: "1.5",
        2.5: "2.5",
      },
      animation: {
        spin: "spin 10s linear infinite",
        loading: "loading-indeterminate-horizontal 1.4s infinite linear",
        "font-weight-grow": "font-weight-grow 1s infinite alternate",
        "font-weight-shrink": "font-weight-shrink 1s infinite alternate",
      },
      keyframes: {
        "loading-indeterminate-horizontal": {
          "0%": { transform: "translateX(0) scaleX(0)" },
          "50%": { transform: "translateX(0) scaleX(0.4)" },
          "100%": { transform: "translateX(100%) scaleX(0.9)" },
        },
        "font-weight-grow": {
          "0%": { "font-variation-settings": '"wght" 32' },
          "100%": { "font-variation-settings": '"wght" 96' },
        },
        "font-weight-shrink": {
          "0%": { "font-variation-settings": '"wght" 96' },
          "100%": { "font-variation-settings": '"wght" 32' },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  corePlugins: {
    fontWeight: false,
  },
  plugins: [
    require("@tailwindcss/typography"),
    require("@tailwindcss/forms"),
    require("./plugins/fontVariationSettings"), // Only if you use GeistSans and GeistMono
  ],
} satisfies Config
```

## 8. Copy the utilities & plugins

From the downloaded package, you'll need to copy the `utils` and `plugins` folders into the root of your project.

You can copy the whole folders, as they contain the necessary files for the components to work.

## 9. Import the component

You can now import the component and use it in your project.

First create a folder called `ui` at the root of your project. Then copy any components from the downloaded package to this folder.

We recommend using one component at a time, but if you feel like you'll need most/all of the components provided you can copy the whole `ui` folder.

## 10. Tada! You're done

Now you can use the component in your project by following the instructions in the docs here.

Feel free to edit the component to suit your needs, either directly in the component file or by using the props provided.
